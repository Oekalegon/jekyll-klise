# Standalone Article Example

This is a test article that demonstrates how articles without a collection or series are displayed in the "Uncollected" section of the articles page.

## Purpose

This article serves as an example of:
- Articles that don't belong to a specific collection
- How the articles page handles uncollected articles
- The flexibility of the article system

## Content Structure

Even standalone articles can have rich content, including:

- **Headers** and subheaders
- Lists and formatting
- Code blocks
- And more!

This helps demonstrate that not all articles need to be part of a series or collection. Some content stands on its own.
